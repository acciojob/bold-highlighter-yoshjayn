# Instructions 
- You are expected to make changes only in the `script.js` file.
- When you hover over the link, `highlight()` function is called, which changes the color of all the bold words to `green`
- When you hover out of the link, `return_normal()` function is called which reverts the green color back to black
- Write the code for these two functions in `script.js` file
